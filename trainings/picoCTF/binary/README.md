# Binary Exploitation
## Stonks ![p](https://img.shields.io/badge/Points-20-success) ![c](https://img.shields.io/badge/Binary-darkred)

We are given a C source file, so let's search for vulnerabilities. There is a clear _format string_ vulnerability at line 93, in the `buy_stonks` function:

```c
printf("What is your API token?\n");
scanf("%300s", user_buf);
printf("Buying stonks with token:\n");
printf(user_buf);
```

Now we know we can use this to print what we need from the memory. Let's try locally, using a custom `api` file (the flag one) to easily recognize if we got the content, take a bunch of 'A's to try. If we then submit a sequence of `%x`s as input, we will leak the memory and see a sequence of 41, our flag file.

With no hesitation we can simply connect to the remote program and do the same, leaking at some point (after converting it into ascii) `ocip{FTC0l_I4_t5m_ll0m_y_y3n2fc10a10\xff\xfb\x00}` that is clearly our flag. 

Just reverse it 4 by 4 characters and we obtain the flag: **picoCTF{I_l05t_4ll_my_m0n3y_1cf201a0}**

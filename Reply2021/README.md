> The evil Zer0 is nowhere to be found. The Five Legends and R-boy decide to look for their enemyâ€™s hideout in the hope of finding some clues. IronCode and R-boy interrogate the ex-cell mate of Zer0, but he talks only in the puzzled language of the ancient Ordos. Help the two heroes discover the clues by decrypting the strange language.

This challenge gives 3 files to the player: [a block of symbols](https://github.com/gregalletti/CTF_writeups/blob/main/Reply2021/One%20step%20at%20a%20time/maze.txt), [a map](https://github.com/gregalletti/CTF_writeups/blob/main/Reply2021/One%20step%20at%20a%20time/map.txt) and [an example](https://github.com/gregalletti/CTF_writeups/blob/main/Reply2021/One%20step%20at%20a%20time/example.txt). The goal here was to find in the 100x100 block of symbols the flag, using the content of the map file in order to decode it. The example.txt file gived an example of how to use the map to retrieve the flag. We figured out that to each of the 1000 maps in the map file should have correspect one letter of the maze text and after some tries we identified this pattern:

map:
```
 #nD>Q1={48
 1
 6
 4
 2@7B81U:*7
```

The first and the last rows indicates the start and the finish of the block to be considered to find the corresponding letter. The second/fourth line gives and indication of how many rows to move up/down from the start/finish. The middle row is the distance to the right from the start of the considered block.
Gived this knowledge, we wrote a symple python script to retrieve the identified letters:

```python
mapp = open("map.txt", "r").read()
maze = open("maze.txt", "r").read()

mapps = mapp.split("\n\n")
for m in mapps:
	map_parts = m.split("\n")
	map_start = map_parts[0]
	map_end  = map_parts[4]

	coded_letter = maze[maze.find(map_start):maze.find(map_end)]
	coded_letter = coded_letter.split("\n")

	distance = 100 - len(coded_letter[0])

	try:
		print(coded_letter[int(map_parts[1])][distance + int(map_parts[2])] , end = "")
	except:
		print(" ", end = "")

```

which outputs
```

```
here, we can see the string ```{FLG:y0U_L34rNt-Th3.l4ngUa e-0f_tHe*4nC13nt5-Ord0s}``` with a missing letter in the middle for the nature of the script. With lookup by hand for that character we managed to retrieve the correct flag:

**{FLG:y0U_L34rNt-Th3.l4ngUa6e-0f_tHe*4nC13nt5-Ord0s}**


### THE PUZZLE
![c](https://img.shields.io/badge/Coding-orange) ![p](https://img.shields.io/badge/Points-200-success) ![a](https://img.shields.io/badge/author-grigg0swagg0,_b4g4,_dondonati-lightgrey)

> Thanks to the ex-con, R-boy and IronCode discover that Zer0 has hidden an encrypted file in the Forbidden Forest, which contains the coordinates of his secret lair. The file is protected by a giant dragon. Help R-Boy and IronCode defeat the dragon and take the file.

The goal of this challenge was to find in the [puzzle](https://github.com/gregalletti/CTF_writeups/blob/main/Reply2021/THE%20PUZZLE/puzzle.txt) a secret code in order to access the [zip file](https://github.com/gregalletti/CTF_writeups/blob/main/Reply2021/THE%20PUZZLE/secret_room.zip) and so getting the flag. The structure of the puzzle was given by the first few rows of it:
>First two numbers are the height and the width of the grid in which the puzzle pieces will be placed, then all the pieces are listed in a random order. 
Every piece is composed by 4 numbers each representing an edge of the piece: upper edge, under edge, left edge and right edge. Two pieces can be connected only if the edges are equal (i.e. in order to place a piece on the left of another piece then the right edge and the left edge respectively have to be equal). 
Some pieces also have a character engraved on them. Solving the puzzle will reveal the secret code.

Given that, we started by selecting a starting point from which to start reconstructing the puzzle. We choose the upper left corner and we identified that as the piece whose first and third number didn't match respectivly with the second and fourth number of any other piece. In order to find it we wrote the function:

```python
puz = open("source.txt", "r").read()	#source.txt: sanitized puzzle without the first rows of text and size
puzzle = puz.split("\n")
def findCorner():
	for i,row in enumerate(puzzle):
		words = row.split(" ")
		print(i)
		found = True
		for row2 in puzzle:
			words2 = row2.split(" ")
			if words[0] == words2[1]:
				found = False
				break
			if words[2] == words2[3]:
				found = False
				break
		if found:
			print(i)
			return i
corner_index = findCorner()
```

This code returns the index of the row corresponding to our corner.
Now that we found our starting point, we wrote an iterative search script that for each piece searches for the element at its right untill the end of the row of the puzzle, then it finds the first element at the start of the following row and so on. This procedure is implemented in the code below:

```python
big_puzzle = [[0]*200]*200
big_puzzle[0][0] = puzzle[corner]

for i in range(199):
	for j in range(199):
		words = big_puzzle[i][j].split(" ")
		for row in puzzle:
			words_against = row.split(" ")
			if words[3] == words_against[2]:
				if words_against[4] != "":
					print(words_against[4])
				big_puzzle[i][j+1] = row

	words = big_puzzle[i][0].split(" ")
	for row in puzzle:
		words_against = row.split(" ")
		if words[1] == words_against[0]:
			if words_against[4] != "":
				print(words_against[4])
			big_puzzle[i+1][0] = row
```

The output of it is: ```RPZwJYegNTPHjNQEALlFigcYxqhDBWVP``` which is exactly the password to access the flag in the zip file.

Resulting flag:

**{FLG:++---N0t_4_H4mM3r---||}**

We can easily see that, as hinted, the modulus N is too small. In this way we can simply factor it (factordb) and get P and Q.  
Now we can calculate `PHI = (P-1)*(Q-1)` and `D = E^(-1) mod PHI`, to decrypt the given C we just calculate `M = C^D mod N` and convert it into text.

Flag: **picoCTF{sma11_N_n0_g0od_73918962}**


### Easy Peasy
![c](https://img.shields.io/badge/Crypto-orange) ![p](https://img.shields.io/badge/Points-40-success)

We are given a Python script granting an OTP encryption, so let's analyze it and find some weaknesses.  
Here is how the program works: it first encrypts the flag, then a loop is performed to get our input and encrypt it using a key of 50000 lenght, leading to different encryption of the same characters in different inputs. *start* is where the needed key part sholud start, and *stop* is where it should end.  
The most important rule of an One Time Pad is that the key is never reused in part or in whole. We notice this in the encryption part:
```python
if stop >= KEY_LEN:
   stop = stop % KEY_LEN
   key = kf[start:] + kf[:stop]
```
This means that if we reach the end of the key, we will restart and reuse the key from the beginning! Knowing that, we can trick the program in our favour.

Let's send 49968 characters (added to 32 of the flag we reach 50000), and then 32 chosen characters: we will obtain the characters encrypted with the SAME key as the flag.  
**Note:** at first I sent 32 'A's to encrypt, but I soon realized that sending 32 null bytes would lead to a quicker solution.

Let's first recover the encrypted flag by just connecting with `nc mercury.picoctf.net 41934`, so `0345376e1e5406691d5c076c4050046e4000036a1a005c6b1904531d3941055d`.  
Let's send this `python -c "print('A'*49968);print(b'\x00'*32)" | nc mercury.picoctf.net 41934` obtaining `6227515c7863625c7838615c7862345c7830345c7866385c7830307b5c786464`, our key.  

Now we just need to XOR the two values and obtain the flag:
```python
>>> ef=0x0345376e1e5406691d5c076c4050046e4000036a1a005c6b1904531d3941055d
>>> k=0x6227515c7863625c7838615c7862345c7830345c7866385c7830307b5c786464
>>> '{:x}'.format(ef^k)
'6162663266376435656466303832303238303736626664376134636665396139'
```
Translated into ASCII text, this will show the flag to submit and get the points.

Flag: **picoCTF{abf2f7d5edf082028076bfd7a4cfe9a9}**

# Binary Exploitation
### Stonks
![c](https://img.shields.io/badge/Binary-red) ![p](https://img.shields.io/badge/Points-20-success)

We are given a C source file, so let's search for vulnerabilities. There is a clear *format string* vulnerability at line 93, in the `buy_stonks` function:

```c
printf("What is your API token?\n");
scanf("%300s", user_buf);
printf("Buying stonks with token:\n");
printf(user_buf);
```

Now we know we can use this to print what we need from the memory. Let's try locally, using a custom `api` file (the flag one) to easily recognize if we got the content, take a bunch of 'A's to try. If we then submit a sequence of `%x`s as input, we will leak the memory and see a sequence of 41, our flag file.

With no hesitation we can simply connect to the remote program and do the same, leaking at some point (after converting it into ascii) `ocip{FTC0l_I4_t5m_ll0m_y_y3n2fc10a10\xff\xfb\x00}` that is clearly our flag. 

Just reverse it 4 by 4 characters and we obtain the flag: **picoCTF{I_l05t_4ll_my_m0n3y_1cf201a0}**

# Reverse Engineering
### Speeds and feeds

We connect to a remote server and we get as result a veeeery long output, let's write it on a file and take a look. We can immediately see every lines starts with G, and then X/Y/Z and some numerical values: this is G-Code, used by 3D printers (luckily enough I already solved a G-Code challenge).

We can then paste the code on [this](https://ncviewer.com/) Simulator and view the result:

# Forensics
### tunn3l v1s10n
![c](https://img.shields.io/badge/Forensics-blue) ![p](https://img.shields.io/badge/Points-40-success)

The given file has no extension and strings or other commands seems not to lead to something useful, so let's try to find a suitable file format through exiftool. The result suggest this is a BMP file, and we are quite sure about it by opening it with an hex editor: the magic bytes are correct (42 4d, 'BM') so we will probably need to "fix" this file to obtain the flag.

Let's start to analyze it, and we can soon see two BAD00000 patterns in the header, indicating that these are the bytes we need to fix: 

`00000000  42 4d 8e 26 2c 00 00 00  00 00 ba d0 00 00 ba d0  |BM.&,...........|`
According to BMP files structure we have: 
- 42 4d 
- 8e 26 2c 00
- 00 00
- 00 00

### MacroHard WeakEdge
![c](https://img.shields.io/badge/Forensics-blue) ![p](https://img.shields.io/badge/Points-60-success)

We are given a Powerpoint file with macros (.pptm), this seems like a "classic" MS Office malware challenge. By opening the file with Powerpoint on Windows I could not see all macros, only a `not_flag() one`, clearly not the flag.

PPTM files use ZIP and XML to compress and organize the data into a single file, so I decided to analyze the file with `binwalk`: after loads of zip archives representing the various slides and their content, two interesting ones are displayed: `ppt/vbaProject.bin` and `ppt/slideMasters/hidden`.

The first one should contain macros, but given that somehow they are hidden I decided to first check the second one. This turns out right, because looking at the `hidden` file we can see `Z m x h Z z o g c G l j b 0 N U R n t E M W R f d V 9 r b j B 3 X 3 B w d H N f c l 9 6 M X A 1 f Q` as result.  
This looks like base64, so removing spaces and decoding it will lead to the flag: 
```bash
cat ppt/slideMasters/hidden | tr -d ' ' | base64 -d
```
Flag: **picoCTF{D1d_u_kn0w_ppts_r_z1p5}**

### Trivial Flag Transfer Protocol
![c](https://img.shields.io/badge/Forensics-blue) ![p](https://img.shields.io/badge/Points-90-success)

We are given a .pcap file, by opening it on Wireshark I immediately saw the TFTP protocol, and following the various treams it seems to exchange some files. Remember that ith TFTP we can not encrypt in any way, so we can easily access those files with `File > Export Objects > TFTP`, getting some interesting ones.

The first one is `instructions.txt`, saying: `GSGCQBRFAGRAPELCGBHEGENSSVPFBJRZHFGQVFTHVFRBHESYNTGENAFSRE.SVTHERBHGNJNLGBUVQRGURSYNTNAQVJVYYPURPXONPXSBEGURCYNA`. This seems a rotation cipher (yes, ROT13) actually saying: `TFTPDOESNTENCRYPTOURTRAFFICSOWEMUSTDISGUISEOURFLAGTRANSFER.FIGUREOUTAWAYTOHIDETHEFLAGANDIWILLCHECKBACKFORTHEPLAN`. Plan, huh?

This gets my attention because we have another file `plan`, and by opening it we get `VHFRQGURCEBTENZNAQUVQVGJVGU-QHRQVYVTRAPR.PURPXBHGGURCUBGBF`, again with ROT13 we get `IUSEDTHEPROGRAMANDHIDITWITH-DUEDILIGENCE.CHECKOUTTHEPHOTOS`. 

We still have one `program.deb` and 3 photos, all seems so be right.

At the time of the challenge I had no access to my Linux VM, so I just tried to "decode" the images to see if they contained some sort of steganography. It turns out that the `picture3.bmp` hides the flag, so probably the `program.deb` is a debian package of steghide. 

Using [this](https://futureboy.us/stegano/decinput.html) online tool and the password DUEDILIGENCE i managed to extract the flag: **picoCTF{h1dd3n_1n_pLa1n_51GHT_18375919}**

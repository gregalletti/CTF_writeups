# picoCTF - picoGym (Score: **12440**)
In this section I will store some writeups for the challenges I managed to solve in the picoGym, except the trivial ones.

Writeups are divided by their category, there are waaay to many challenges:
- [General Skills](https://github.com/gregalletti/CTF_writeups/tree/main/trainings/picoCTF/general/README.md)
- [Cryptography](https://github.com/gregalletti/CTF_writeups/tree/main/trainings/picoCTF/crypto/README.md)
- [Binary Exploitation](https://github.com/gregalletti/CTF_writeups/tree/main/trainings/picoCTF/binary/README.md)
- [Web Exploitation](https://github.com/gregalletti/CTF_writeups/tree/main/trainings/picoCTF/web/README.md)
- [Reverse Engineering](https://github.com/gregalletti/CTF_writeups/tree/main/trainings/picoCTF/reverse/README.md)
